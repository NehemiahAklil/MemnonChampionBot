  Hello, my name is Memnon the Mythical King. 
  I am here to make your boring ww games more fun.
  What I basically do is pick a certain group of roles with some similarities and nominate them as my champion roles for the game. 
  If the nominated champion roles win, I will give them each 4 stars and an additional one star for champions who make it out alive. 
  I will also reward 3 stars to any ally that wins with them
  But if the nominated champion roles lose, I will give a point each, to the roles that won.

  <b>General commands</b>
    /nominate_champ - I will give your a random champ roles for the games
    /curr_nominee - I will show the currently selected champ roles, incase you have forgotten
    /tpchamps - I will send the list of champions in the gc, according to their star ranks
    /champstat - I will send your current champion stats in the gc

  <b>Admin only commands</b>
    /gain_favours - Reply to the game end message and I will give stars according to the selected champ roles for the game
    /addstr &lt;args&gt;- I will add stars to the users champ stats
    /rmstr &lt;args&gt;- I will remove stars from the users champ stats

  P.S arguments need to be a number less than 5, or I will just ignore you and add 5 stars. 
  If you send it without arguments it will be 3 stars
